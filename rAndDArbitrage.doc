What is DEX Arbitrage Bot:- 
DEX arbitrage, also known as decentralized exchange arbitrage, refers to the practice of taking advantage of price discrepancies between different decentralized 
exchanges (DEXs). DEXs are platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries.

Arbitrage is a strategy where traders exploit temporary differences in asset prices across different markets to make a profit. In the case of DEX arbitrage, 
traders seek to profit from price inefficiencies that occur when the same cryptocurrency is traded on multiple DEXs simultaneously.

The process of DEX arbitrage typically involves the following steps:
Identifying price discrepancies: Traders monitor the prices of a particular cryptocurrency across different DEXs. 
They look for instances where the price of the same cryptocurrency is significantly higher on one exchange compared to another.
Initiating trades: When a price discrepancy is identified, the trader executes a series of trades to take advantage of the price difference. 
They buy the cryptocurrency on the exchange where it is cheaper and simultaneously sell it on the exchange where it is more expensive.

Profit realization: By exploiting the price discrepancy, the trader aims to make a profit. The profit is derived from the difference in prices, 
minus any transaction fees or slippage incurred during the trades.

DEX arbitrage can be a profitable strategy because DEXs are decentralized, meaning that they operate independently and are not connected through a central order book
This can result in price differences due to varying liquidity levels, trading volumes, and market dynamics across different DEXs. However, it's worth noting that 
DEX arbitrage also comes with risks. The decentralized nature of DEXs can introduce challenges such as slower transaction speeds, higher gas fees (transaction 
fees on the Ethereum network), and the potential for price volatility during the execution of trades. Traders need to carefully consider these factors and develop 
effective risk management strategies when engaging in DEX arbitrage.
