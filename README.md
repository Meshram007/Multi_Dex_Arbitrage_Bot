## Dex_Arbitrage_Bot
DEX arbitrage, also known as decentralized exchange arbitrage, refers to the practice of taking advantage of price discrepancies between different decentralized exchanges (DEXs). DEXs are platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries.

Arbitrage is a strategy where traders exploit temporary differences in asset prices across different markets to make a profit. In the case of DEX arbitrage, traders seek to profit from price inefficiencies that occur when the same cryptocurrency is traded on multiple DEXs simultaneously.
